# Tutorial 2: Introduction to Machine Learning in R

This tutorial contains exercise to get students familiar with implementing machine learning methods in R.

It follows the same workflow as last week's Python tutorial, but in R.

In this, students are asked to use the IRIS dataset to gain experience in manipulating data in R dataframes, visualising the data in simple plots, and implementing the closed form solution of linear regression using least squares.

### RMarkdown

In this tutorial you will complete the code blocks in `2_ML_in_R.Rmd`.

RMarkdown is analagous to Jupyter Notebooks - it allows you to mix code blocks, text and plots in the same document.

It is slightly different to Jupyter Notebook but fulfills the same purpose - prototyping code.

One difference is that you cannot easily view the .Rmd or compiled html files on GitHub, so use RStudio/your browser for this.

See [this cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for the most common commands.
